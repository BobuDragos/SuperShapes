# 🌀 SuperShapes 2D
SuperShapes 2D is a C/C++ implementation of the superformula algorithm to generate visually stunning geometric shapes. There are 7 possible variations of the shape that you can generate, all with adjustable parameters.

This project was developed as part of my Introduction To Programming course for my Computer Science bachelor's degree.
